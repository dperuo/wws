## Important Things To Know
There are a few things you need to know before we start working together.

### Medical Clearance
Please be smart. Exercise can be dangerous and it's your responsibility to obtain medical clearance before we begin. Working with us means you've spoken with your doctor and have been cleared for this type of exercise. Working with us also means that you understand the risks and take full responsibility if anything goes wrong. 

### Privacy Policy
We value your privacy and will keep your information secure and confidential at all times. 

### Training on Your Own
You may need to train on your own. These workouts will be designed as part of your program.

### Sleep, Stress, and Nutrition
Good eating, sleeping, and stress management skills may be discussed as part of your program. 

### Payments and Session Info
All sessions are paid for in advance. We offer an automatic renewal option to make this process easier. If you opt in for automatic renewal, you give us permission to charge your credit card each time your training package reaches 2 sessions or less. We will email you a confirmation before charging your card. You can cancel automatic renewal at any time.

### Refunds
If youâ€™re a new client and don't like what we do after your first two sessions with us, we'll give you a full refund. After that, sessions are non-refundable, but can be transferred to another person.

### Cancellations and Rescheduling
Please give us at least 24-hours notice if you need to cancel or reschedule. We will do the same. If you cancel or reschedule with less than 24-hours notice, you will lose the session.

### Referrals
If you refer someone to us and they buy training sessions, you will receive a complementary massage with our favorite massage therapist. She's awesome; you'll like her!
