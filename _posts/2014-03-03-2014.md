## Service Options for 2014

Workouts For Wall Streetâ„  combines personal training with lifestyle management to remove pain, reduce stress and improve flexibility. The service is offered for a flat fee.

Personal training is usually sold by the number of sessions. These hourly rates create a conflict of interest between the client and the trainer because the trainer wants to sell more sessions, even when it's unnecessary for the client. Our flat rates mean you can use our service as often as you like without making an investment decision every time.

We know how busy you are, and our flat fee ensures that you'll reach your goals in the shortest, most effective way possible.
