## Service Options for 2014

Workouts For Wall Street℠ combines personal training with lifestyle management to remove pain, reduce stress and improve flexibility. The service is offered for a flat fee. 

Personal training is usually sold by the number of sessions. This creates a conflict of interest between the client and the trainer because the trainer is rewarded for selling more sessions and spending more time with the client, even when unnecessary.

We know how busy you are, and our flat fee ensures that you'll reach your goals in the shortest, most effective way possible.
