## Service Options for 2014

Workouts For Wall Street℠ combines personal training with lifestyle management to remove pain, reduce stress and improve flexibility. The service is offered for a flat fee. 

Personal training is usually sold by the number of sessions. This creates a conflict of interest between the client and the trainer because the trainer is rewarded for selling more sessions, even when unnecessary for the client.

Our flat fee ensures that your goals and our goals align. You can use our service as much or as little as you want.
