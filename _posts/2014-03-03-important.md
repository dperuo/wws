## Important Things To Know
There are a few things you need to know before we start working together.

### Medical Clearance
Please be smart. Exercise can be dangerous and it's your responsibility to obtain medical clearance before we begin. Working with us means you've spoken with your doctor and have been cleared for this type of exercise. Working with us also means that you understand all the risks and take full responsibility if anything goes wrong. 

### Privacy Policy
We value your privacy and will keep your information secure and confidential at all times. 

### Training On Your Own
You may need to train on your own. These workouts will be designed as part of your program.

### Sleep, Stress, and Nutrition
Good eating, sleeping, and stress management skills may be discussed as part of your program. 

### Payments and Session Info
All services are paid for in advance. We offer an automatic renewal option to make this process easier. If you opt in for automatic renewal, you give us permission to charge your credit card each time you're up for renewal. You can cancel automatic renewal at any time.

### Refunds
If youâ€™re a new client and don't like what we do after your first two weeks with us, we'll give you a full refund. After that, services are non-refundable, but can be transferred to another person.

### Cancellations and Rescheduling
Please give us at least 24-hours notice if you need to cancel or reschedule a training session. We will do the same. If you cancel or reschedule with less than 24-hours notice, you will lose the session.

### Training With Friends
Training in a small group of 2 or 3 is also available. This is a great option for friends and colleagues with similar goals!

### Referrals
If you refer someone to us and they buy training sessions, you will receive a complementary massage with our favorite massage therapist!

### Next Step
Working with us means that you've read this page carefully and understand what it says. If you have any questions, please contact us.
